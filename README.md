## Project Overview
This repository contains the complete implementation, analysis, and results for a collaborative team project completed as part of a Machine Learning course.

The objective of this project was to apply supervised machine learning techniques to a real-world **dating dataset**, analyzing user attributes and interaction patterns to predict outcomes such as match success and compatibility. The dataset includes demographic information, personal preferences, and behavioral features commonly found in dating platforms.

The project was developed collaboratively, with team members contributing across all stages of the machine learning pipeline, including:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and biases in dating behavior
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation
- Interpretation of results
